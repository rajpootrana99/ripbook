        <p>This cookie policy (&ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) describes how Ripbook.com &amp; Web Announcements Ltd. (&ldquo;Company,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; and &ldquo;our&rdquo;) collects, uses and shares personal data when using this website (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and the associated applications(s), (the &ldquo;Applications&rdquo;), together (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). Please read the following information carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>
        <h4>1. COOKIES</h4>
        <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
        <p>We may collect information using &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them or they expire after a set period which varies depending on the cookie) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services.</p>
        <p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Services; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Services, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies we use</strong></p>
        <p>Our Services use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>
        <p>Essential Cookies - These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Services and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, we use session cookies to provide you secure access to your account details and prevent others from accessing your account. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p>
        <p>Functionality Cookies - These cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make when you use our Services, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and search filter choices to help prefill search forms on subsequent visits to the site. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Services.</p>
        <p>Analytics and Performance Cookies - These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Services and how users use our Services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to our Services, the websites that referred them to our Services, the pages they visited on our Services, what time of day they visited our Services, whether they have visited our Services before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Services.</p>
        <p>We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how our Services works. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies.</p>
        <p>You can find out more about how Google protects your data here: www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.</p>
        <p>You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Services by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB.</p>
        <p>Targeted and advertising Cookies - These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites.</p>
        <p>You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.</p>
        <p>Social Media Cookies - These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or &ldquo;like&rdquo; button on our Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The social network will record that you have done this.</p>
        <p><strong>Disabling cookies</strong></p>
        <p>You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the &ldquo;settings,&rdquo; &ldquo;help&rdquo; &ldquo;tools&rdquo; or &ldquo;edit&rdquo; facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.</p>
        <p>Further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.com.uk.</p>
        <p>If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you will not be able to log in and stay logged in, and we will not be able to remember your language preferences.</p>
        <p><strong>2. FLASH TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
        <p>We may also use Flash cookies (which are also known as Flash Local Shared Object (&ldquo;LSOs&rdquo;)) on our Services to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Unlike other cookies, Flash cookies cannot be removed or rejected via your browser settings. If you do not want Flash cookies stored on your computer or mobile device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel at https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel at https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our Services.</p>
        <p><strong>3. PIXEL TAGS</strong></p>
        <p>We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Services to track the actions of users on our Services. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users&rsquo; personal data.</p>
        <p><strong>4. DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</strong></p>
        <p>Some Internet browsers may be configured to send &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to do not track signals. To find out more about &quot;Do Not Track,&quot; please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>
        <p><strong>5. ADVERTISING</strong></p>
        <p>Generally. We may use other companies to serve third-party advertisements when you visit and use the Services. These companies may collect and use click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over during your visits to the Services and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use tracking technologies to collect this information. Other companies use of their tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
        <p>Targeted Advertising. In order to serve offers and advertisements that may interest you, we may display targeted advertisements on the Services, or other digital properties or applications in conjunction with our content based on information provided to us by our users and information provided to us by third parties that they have independently collected. We do not provide personal data to advertisers when you interact with an advertisement.</p>
        <p>Your Ad Choices. Some of the third party services providers and/or advertisers may be members of the Network European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (&quot;EDAA&quot;) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioural Advertising. To learn more, visit http://www.edaa.eu/edaa-for-users which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the &quot;opt-out&quot; procedures of EDAA members.</p>
        <p>Mobile. We may, from time to time, offer certain location or pinpoint based services, such as location assisted navigation instruction. If you elect to use such location-based services, we must periodically receive your location in order to provide such location-based services to you. By using the location-based services, you authorise us to: (i) locate your hardware; (ii) record, compile and display your location; and (iii) publish your location to third parties designated by you by means of location publication controls available within the applications (for example, settings, user preferences). As part of the location-based services, we may also collect and store certain information about the users who elect to use such location-based services, such as a device ID. This information will be used to provide you the location-based services. We may use third-party providers to help provide such location-based services through mobile systems and we may make information available to such providers to enable them to provide their location-based services, provided that such third party providers may use the information only in accordance with this Policy.</p>
